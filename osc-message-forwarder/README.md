# osc-message-forwarder.py

This can be used to forward all OSC messages from VRChat / Port 9001 to whatever clients you setup. This is particularly useful if you're using OSC tools that others have made that listen for outputs from VRChat.

Could probably optimize it by filtering specific messages, but this hasn't been an issue for me.

This is setup to match what I use it for. Names are related to tools I use.
