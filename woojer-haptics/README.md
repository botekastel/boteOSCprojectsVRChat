# haptics.py

I use this script to send audio files to my Woojer Edge Vest based on VRChat parameters.  The sounds used are meant to be positional, allowing a Woojer Edge Vest to act as touch haptics in VRChat. Requires Physbone contacts and the parameters to match.

Purely proof of concept. 

Server listens on port 9006.
